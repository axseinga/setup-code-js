## Overview

### The project

Hi there!

I created this boilerplate code and setup to not have to go over every time with webpack configuration. It is all ready for coding projects with HTML/CSS/JS with use of scscc (dart-sass with @use and @forward).

Please feel free to use it and change it if you want.

Tested and deployed to Netlify.

Monster picture comes from the Internet ;)
